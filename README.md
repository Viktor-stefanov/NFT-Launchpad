# NFT Launchpad with ERC20 Token

### Project Description

This project is a simple NFT marketplace which utilizes the ERC721 standart and combines it with an internal ERC20 token called "NFTO". Users can mint their own NFTs, the first mint is free and each subsequent one costs 5 NFTOs + some amount based on how many NFTs the user has minted. Users can list their NFTs on the marketplace (selling for NFTOs) and other users can buy those NFTs. Users of the app can also stake their NFTs for a monthly reward paid out in NFTO (50 NFTO / 30 days).

### Setup

1. Copy the project locally (either via git clone or installing the zip)
2. Run "npm install"
3. Start the local blockchain network "npm run node"
4. Start up the server "npm run serve"
5. Open up localhost:8080 and use the DApp!
